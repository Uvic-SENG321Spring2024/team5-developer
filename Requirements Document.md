#### **4.2 Operating Environment**

#### **4.3 Design and Implmentation Constraints**

Through the design and implementation of the product, developers have a few limitations when implementing the product. Firstly, developers are required to make the product only run on a Windows machine and nothing else. The product has to communicate between Iris and SysAid, two different applications. It must communicate the information inputted into Iris to SysAid because Consumer Protection BC requires it to keep both applications due to Iris not having a ticketing system. Finally, account permissions and overall security of information being sent from Iris to SysAid must be kept secure, private and maintained through the automated process of transferring information.
